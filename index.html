    <h3 class="project-title">Advanced Text-to-Speech Editor</h3>
    <p class="project-date">May 2021</p>
    <p class="project-info">
      Associated with University of Ioannina<br>
      The objective of this project is to develop an application that allows to edit and transform documents to audio. The documents may be in various formats. Specifically the application supports at least Microsoft Word (.docx) and Excel documents (.xlsx). For privacy and security reasons the contents of the documents may be encoded with different encoding mechanisms. The target users of the application may be people who have reading problems or visually impaired people. The application consists of a graphical user interface, a back-end that enables the text editing process and the part that transforms text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries.

    <h3 class="project-title">Web app for photo sharing in Ruby-on-Rails</h3>
    <p class="project-info">
      Associated with University of Ioannina<br>
      A photo sharing web application allows users to open an account and then log in to the application in order to upload photos to the server and make them accessible to other users. We assume that the accounts are public. Each user can select specific users they wish to follow. When a followed user posts a photo, the following user sees the photo the next time they refresh their page in the application. The photos of the user and the followed users are displayed in reverse chronological order of publication. A user can add comments to a photo they post or to photos of users they follow. Finally, a user can delete a previously posted photo with all its comments.
